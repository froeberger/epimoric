# epimoric

I name this repository 'epimoric', which is synonymous with 'super-particular'.  It signifies proportions or ratios or fractions composed of positive integers where [ (x+1) : x ] OR [ (x+1) / x ].  Examples are 2:1, 3:2, 4/3, 5/4, etc.  I feel Claudius Ptolemy correctly surmised this wisdom: that all of harmony and harmonics are rooted in epimoric proportions...


This repository collects and releases to the public my own software and any supplementary, educational materials.  The software allows one to compose microtonal scales from pitch intervals which are epimoric proportions or derived therefrom.  It also allows one to directly compose scales with the same ratios.  Both means produce a Scala tuning file (.scl) with which I produce in modern, digital audio workstations music NOT tuned to the conventional standard of equal temperament.  Microtonality is possible in Bitwig Studio, Ableton Live and possibly other digital audio workstations with the use of a Scala tuning file in addition to defining the root ( i.e. 'tonic' ) key of the composition.


This software will be included in a computational notebook and technical report / essay I am currently authoring and which is entitled 'Tuning Perfect Consonance: musical pitch ratios and intervals derived from epimoric proportions'.  This work will be added to this repository as it matures and readies for public consumption and publication.


All of this is released to you, and to anyone, under a 'free NOT fee', open source license of my own creation which legally stipulates that any and all are free to consume, modify, copy, distribute, download, and enjoy so long as:

             Financial loss caused by the use, distribution, etc. of this software is, however, not only acceptable, but perhaps even desirable and 
             honorable...   ;-)
             
             
Enjoy!
