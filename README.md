# epimoric

I name this repository 'epimoric', which is synonymous with 'super-particular'.  It signifies proportions or ratios or fractions composed of positive integers where  (x+1) : x  OR  (x+1) / x .  Examples are 2:1, 3:2, 4/3, 5/4, etc.  I feel Claudius Ptolemy correctly surmised this wisdom: that all of harmony and harmonics are rooted in epimoric proportions...


This repository collects and releases to the public my own software and any supplementary, educational materials.  The software allows one to compose microtonal scales from pitch intervals which are epimoric proportions or derived therefrom.  It also allows one to directly compose scales with the same ratios.  Both means produce a Scala tuning file (.scl) with which I produce in modern, digital audio workstations music NOT tuned to the conventional standard of equal temperament.  Microtonality is possible in Bitwig Studio, Ableton Live and possibly other digital audio workstations with the use of a Scala tuning file in addition to defining the root ( i.e. 'tonic' ) key of the composition.


Why did I code this in the Wolfram Language?  Because when I do, I do well.  The fundamentals of music always were, are, and forever will be based upon positive-integer PROPORTIONS.  Ain't no decimal point, no need for floating point digits, no square root of 2, nor anything that can not be expressed properly as a positive-integer fraction or ratio.  A programming language that discretely converts my positive-integer ratios to floating point numbers and then does floating point arithmetic on them and then discretely converts them back to seeming positive-integer ratios is like SLAPPING ME IN THE FACE WHILE CALLING ME STUPID.  Goodbye Python, and a whole host of other, inferior programming languages for this job.  A failure to understand this means that we can not even be friends.


The nature of these calculations necessitate a programming language with native, RATIONAL ARITHMETIC IN COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ANY FLOATING-POINT ARITHMETIC.  I had therefore only two choices: Julia or Wolfram Language.  I chose Wolfram for the maturity and robustness of functionality, despite its not being an open-source option.  It is a damned fine tool, and the best one for the job.  Again, when I do, I do well.


This software will be included in a computational notebook and technical report / essay I am currently authoring and which is entitled 'Tuning Perfect Consonance: musical pitch ratios and intervals derived from epimoric proportions'.  This work will be added to this repository as it matures and readies for public consumption and publication.
